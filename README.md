# Tic Tac Py - Tkinter Edition

This is Tic Tac Py - Tkinter Edition which is currently an open beta.

# Installing the software

Just download the game from the releases, extract the archive and have fun. Those using Avira may need to get the game from quarantine. macOS users need to install Python and download the source code due to me not having a Mac. :(

# Building the software for Windows

You will need a machine where Windows and Python are installed.

1. Download the source code.
2. Extract the archive.
3. Open a command prompt in the directory.
4. Type in the following command: pyinstaller --onefile main.py
5. Copy the doc and gamemodes folders into the directory where the binary is.
6. Test the result. You may need to get the executable out of quarantine first.
