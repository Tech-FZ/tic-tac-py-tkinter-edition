# Tic Tac Py - Tkinter Edition

This is Tic Tac Py - Tkinter Edition which is currently an open beta.

## We're Using GitHub Under Protest

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project.  We have an
[open issue](https://github.com/Tech-FZ/tic-tac-py-tkinter-edition/issues/34) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please 
contact me at lucien-rowan#1916 on Discord so we can find a solution together.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.

# Installing the software

Just download the game from the releases, extract the archive and have fun. Those using Avira may need to get the game from quarantine. macOS users need to install Python and download the source code due to me not having a Mac. :( Linux users however can download the binaries for their machine, but shouldn't have the problem Windows users possibly have.

# Building the software

See BUILDING.md in the docs folder for instructions.

# Contribute

Good at making icons? Wanna help translate the game so more people can play? Any other ideas? You're always welcome to contribute.
NEW RULE: Before you can do that, you must comment on an issue or - if not yet available - open a new one stating that you will fix or add it yourself.
