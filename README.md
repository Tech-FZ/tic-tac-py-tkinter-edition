# Tic Tac Py - Tkinter Edition

Due to the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign, the fact that Tic Tac Py and especially its repository became too complex to be migrated as-is and the game being a beginner project with no real future anyway, the owner decided to discontinue and archive the repository, meaning you can no longer contribute here. Thanks to everyone who considered using/showing this program, especially to my family who gave feedback for it.

## But you migrated some other repositories to Codeberg before! Why not this one?

The previous programs that have already been migrated didn't have an updater (yet). I would have tried to migrate this one as well, but the problem is that there are too many branches with previews which were still in development. If I was to give these previews an upgrade for the Tic Tac Py Updater, this would have been a complicated task. For a program which was only written as a practice for better stuff (like EmuGUI or Bomb Quest), this effort is not worth it!

## Can I contribute to Tic Tac Py?

Not to this repository anymore, as it is archived and read-only. If you want to continue development, don't hesitate to fork this. Nicolas Lucien however will no longer support this program.

## Why do you participate in the "Give up GitHub" campaign in the first place?

Some developers, including me, are concerned about how GitHub Copilot has been trained. Microsoft and its subsidiary might have used FOSS code, including those which require you to credit the copyright holders and/or to open-source your derivate as well. If they did train their AI with such code, they are possibly violating copyright and did this without the creator's permission. Even worse is that they made Copilot for profit.

## Okay, I'm concerned about this as well! How do I learn more about this campaign?

The [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/) has made a seperate page just for that. [See Software Freedom Conservancy's *Give Up  GitHub* site for details](https://GiveUpGitHub.org). For me, I already migrated most of my programs to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/).

## We want Tic Tac Py! We want Tic Tac Py!

Okay! If there are enough users who still care about this project, I might as well consider to revive this project. However, please don't expect that to happen.
