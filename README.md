# Tic Tac Py - Tkinter Edition

This is Tic Tac Py - Tkinter Edition which is currently an open beta.

# Installing the software

Just download the game from the releases, extract the archive and have fun. Those using Avira may need to get the game from quarantine. macOS users need to install Python and download the source code due to me not having a Mac. :(

# Building the software for Windows

You will need a machine where Windows and Python are installed.

1. Download the source code
2. Extract the archive
3. Disconnect your computer from the internet and deactivate your antivirus. (Yes, this step is required)
4. Open a command prompt in the directory
