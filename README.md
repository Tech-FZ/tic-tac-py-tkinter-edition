# Tic Tac Py - Tkinter Edition

This is Tic Tac Py - Tkinter Edition which is currently an open beta.

# Installing the software

Just download the game from the releases, extract the archive and have fun. Those using Avira may need to get the game from quarantine. macOS users need to install Python and download the source code due to me not having a Mac. :( Linux users however can download the binaries for their machine, but shouldn't have the problem Windows users possibly have.

# Building the software

See BUILDING.md in the docs folder for instructions.
