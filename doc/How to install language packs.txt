1. Download the language from the Tic Tac Py Tkinter Edition Github page or any other reliable website.

2. Copy the language to the following directories:
Windows: <letter>:\<gamedir>\gamemodes\locales\languages
Linux: /<gamedir>/gamemodes/locales/languages

Please type the actual letter and game directory instead of <letter> and <gamedir>. Due to the lack of a Mac, I can't help those running macOS, so you will have to determine the directory yourself. Running the game on other platforms isn't supported.

3. Start the game. You may need to adjust the language in the settings.

4. If you set the language, you need to restart the game. Then, have fun!
